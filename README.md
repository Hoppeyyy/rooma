Welcome to Rooma Project ! (https://rooma.ca/login)

Rooma is a scheduling and communication aids application for people who live together. The app is designed for people to communicate with each other regarding house rules and chores. By using Rooma, people can create tasks, divide house-hold chores, combine schedules, and find future roommates to live with. Our goal is to build an app that helps resolve issues regarding miscommunication and conflicts between roommates and people who live together.

This application was build with 6 people in total: 3 designers/front-end developers and 3 full-stack developers. We constantly encounted several challenges regarding concept of ideas, user-friendliness designs, and development processes. However, we always respect, communicate, and support each other to overcome the obstacles.
